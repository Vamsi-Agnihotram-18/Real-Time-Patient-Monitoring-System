# IoT Patient Monitoring System
## Project Name: Patient Monitoring System
## Project Duration: February 2024 - June 2024
## Developed by: Vamsi Agnihotram
## Student ID: 016920709

### Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive real-time patient monitoring system designed to manage diabetes and hypertension. The system integrates IoT technology with a MERN stack web application, enabling seamless communication between patients, doctors, and caretakers. It allows for real-time monitoring of vital signs, emergency alerts, and automated health notifications.


### Features

Real-Time Monitoring: Measure and display real-time heart rate and SpO2 levels using a pulse oximetry sensor connected to an Arduino R3.
Web Application: A MERN stack web app with dashboards for doctors and caretakers.
Data Visualization: Real-time data visualization on the web app to monitor patient vitals.
Emergency Alerts: A panic button triggers an emergency alert to notify the caretaker.
Medicine Management: Doctors can prescribe medicines based on patient data, and the prescription is sent to the caretaker via email.
Abnormal Health Alerts: Automated notifications are sent if the patient's health shows abnormal readings.


### Tech Stack

IoT: Arduino R3 for data collection.
Web Application: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (MERN Stack).
Real-Time Data Processing: Integration with Apache Kafka for data streaming.
Testing: Implemented using Selenium for automated testing.


### Setup Instructions
